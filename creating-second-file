a branch is a copy of my main(master) branch, where changes can be made, and afterr it can be merged back to main branch.
$ git branch fixedtemp(a new branch with a name)

User@Jay-pc MINGW64 /c/users/user/git (master)
$ git branch(this cmd shows all branches made)
  fixedtemp
* master
$ git switch fixedtemp(switch cmd allows us to switch from one branch to another)
Switched to branch 'fixedtemp'
User@Jay-pc MINGW64 /c/users/user/git (fixedtemp)
**after making changes on the new branch, we check at the new status 
$ git status
On branch fixedtemp
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   secret recipe.htm
**then we commit our changes so that pple know
$ git commit -a -m "updated temp for baking"(we use -a -m to commit)

*** to merge back the new branch to main (master) branch
